# What Now, Donald? - README

**It's live!** https://bsky.app/profile/whatnowdonald.bsky.social

## üìñ Introduction

**What Now, Donald?** is a TypeScript-based project built using the **AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)**. It is designed to integrate with social media platforms like **Truth Social** and **Bluesky**, leveraging **Google Generative AI** to process posts and generate content. The application fetches posts from Truth Social, analyzes them using AI, and publishes the results to Bluesky while also notifying a Slack channel.

The project is a serverless application that is deployed using AWS infrastructure, including **AWS Lambda**, **DynamoDB**, and **CloudWatch** for scheduling and logging.

## üîß Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gaulatti/what-now-donald.git
    cd what-now-donald
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
    ```plaintext
    GEMINI_CREDENTIALS=<your_google_api_key>
    BLUESKY_USERNAME=<your_bluesky_username>
    BLUESKY_PASSWORD=<your_bluesky_password>
    SLACK_URL=<your_slack_webhook_url>
    CHROMIUM_LAYER_ARN=<your_chromium_layer_arn>
    ```

4. **Build the Project**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

5. **Deploy to AWS**:
    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration. These include:

- `GEMINI_CREDENTIALS`: API key for Google Generative AI.
- `BLUESKY_USERNAME` and `BLUESKY_PASSWORD`: Credentials for Bluesky integration.
- `SLACK_URL`: Webhook URL for sending Slack notifications.
- `CHROMIUM_LAYER_ARN`: ARN for the Chromium layer used by Puppeteer.
- `TABLE_NAME`: DynamoDB table name for tracking processed posts. This is passed by CDK to the lambda.

---

## üöÄ Usage

Once the application is deployed, it will automatically:

1. Fetch posts from Truth Social using a headless browser (Puppeteer).
2. Analyze the content using Google Generative AI.
3. Post the generated content to Bluesky.
4. Notify a Slack channel with a summary and a link to the original post.

You can also test the application locally using the following commands:

- **Run Tests**:
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```
- **Lint Code**:
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```
